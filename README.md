# Burn Classification Using Deep Learning 🔥🧠

This is my graduation project at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI), Egypt.  
We developed a deep learning model to classify burn injuries into:
- First-degree (mild)
- Second-degree (moderate)
- Third-degree (severe)

## 🚀 Features
- Transfer learning using Xception
- Image preprocessing & augmentation
- Model evaluation and accuracy visualization
- Trained model saved in `.h5` format


## 🛠️ Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🛠️ How To use it
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("model/my_model.h5")
